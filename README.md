# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
## Problem statement

A Twitter sentiment analysis identifies negative, positive, or neutral emotions within the text of a tweet. It is a text analysis using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. Tweets are often useful in generating a vast amount of sentiment data upon analysis. These data are useful in understanding the opinion of people on social media for a variety of topics. This Project shows the use of **LSTM** and **Bert model** to find sentiment of tweet data and predicts accuracy of Bert model using ratings 1,2,3,4 or 5.

**Note**
Dataset contains 9976 records with reviews and ratings are having columns. Due to GPU usage limits I have taken here only 500 records and have shown the Accuracy result.
